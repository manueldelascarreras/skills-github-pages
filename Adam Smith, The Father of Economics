        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Adam Smith is widely known for his contributions to moral philosophy and economics. His philosophy emphasized the importance of individual freedom, self-interest, and the role of sympathy in human behavior. Smith's economic philosophy advocated for a free-market economy where individuals' pursuit of self-interest in competitive markets would unintentionally benefit society as a whole through what he described as the "invisible hand." Smith's work helped shape the foundation of modern economics and the capitalist system.</p>
